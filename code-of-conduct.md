Wax Code of conduct
-------------------

Wax is about empowering mankind and its ecosystem. It is expected these
guidelines be followed by every contributor in every interaction with the
project, author or contributors.

* **Be patient**. Patience leads to good code, good relations, good answers.

* **Be respectful**. You are free to do anything you want in your life, since
what you mean by *anything* be limited to you only. Any kind of diversity should
be respected. Enforcing a single "diversity point of view" will also be
considered as an infringement of this principle.

* **Be humble**. If some newbie asks for help, answer them or not. If
you think it is too expensive, its better give no advice. Don't do anything if
there is not good motivations to. Contribute only when you feel happy growing
the community, allowing others to go further and sharing what you know.
It it was a race, only knowlegde and future should win.

* **Be reliable**. If yes, yes. If no, no. Don't interact with the project,
developers or users sarcastically or ironically. People must not be evil neither
understand evil thoughts.

* **Be free**. Be free to contribute, suggest, answer, ask and question. But
never forget that the truly freedom is in the full use of your capabilities
recognizing yours and others limitations.
