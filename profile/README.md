Wax Lua Development
===================

Wax intend to expand the ways you use Lua on everyday needs.


The current mission is provide:

1. **Provide simple and well documented critical modules.** Some basic
things needs today two or three different dependencies, some lacking
functionality, others not well documented and others staled or lacking
support for newer Lua versions.

2. **Avoid boilerplate.** If developers feel comfortable with
their tool, them go further and do more.

2. **Ecosystem.** Provide development tools to enhance the Lua modules
development, documentation and test. Example: T3D (Test Documentation
Driven Development), test container, documentation tools etc.
